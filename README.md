# sortandprintcourselist
This program sorts and prints out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order

The main problem I was solving was how to efficiently sort and print a course list that is stored in a CSV file. This involves parsing the CSV data, applying a sorting algorithm, and then displaying the sorted list.

I approached this problem by first considering the data structures needed. In this case, I needed a way to store and manipulate the course information. For this program I used a hash table to map the data to specific slots within the structure. Understanding data structures is crucial because it determines how efficiently you can perform operations like sorting, searching, and retrieving data.

I referred back to previous projects, zyBook tutorials, and utilized the online student services resources to overcome any roadblocks that I experienced throughout the process.

This project has expanded my understanding of data manipulation and algorithm selection. It has prompted me to consider factors like time complexity and space complexity when choosing sorting algorithms. I've also gained a better understanding of error handling and how to make my program robust to handle unexpected inputs.

When working on this project, I realized the importance of writing code that can adapt to different datasets or file formats. This involves building flexibility into your code, such as allowing for different delimiters in the CSV or handling variations in the data structure.
